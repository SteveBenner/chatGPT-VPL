They lived during three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. Dinosaurs are known for their incredible variety in size, shape, and lifestyle. Some, like the massive Sauropods, were herbivores with long necks and tails, enabling them to reach high vegetation. Others, such as the fierce Theropods like Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor, were carnivorous and walked on two legs.\n\nDinsaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates for over 160 million years, which is significantly longer than the time humans have existed. Their dominance ended abruptly about 66 million years ago in the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, which also wiped out many other species. This event is widely believed to have been caused by a combination of volcanic activity, climate change, and an asteroid impact.\n\nInterestingly, not all dinosaurs went extinct; the Theropods gave rise to birds, which means that dinosaurs,
